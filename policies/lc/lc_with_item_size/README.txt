This simulator undefines all the reuse distance related computation.

It reads in the file of how many items per slab class has, and it computes the miss ratio.

Before running this simulator, make sure the required files such as key_lease, key_slab, slab_mem, etc
are put in the corresponding workload directory.

In addition to the first two parameters -- mode and trace name, it has a third parameter called policy.
It policy is set to 1, then this simulator reads in a memory allocation file called slab_mem generated by LAMA algorithm,
and it will berunning as the test for LAMA.
By default, policy is 0 and you do not need to type "0" in the command line.
The default policy means thes simulator tests a lease policy with base size set to 0 for all the slab classes.

ATTENTION:
Remember to generate a all-0 key_lease file before testing LAMA policy.
The all-0 generator script is in the workloads directory.
